Suppose we want to know how many recursive calls are made in Fibonacci function.
We could do that by counting the number of calls with a **global variable**.

* Normally, functions communicate with their environment **solely** through their parameters and return values. 
* For most of the time, this is the right thing to do. 
* Every once in a while, global variables come in handy.

```
def fib(x):
  """Assumes x an int >= 0
  Returns Fibonacci of x"""

  global numFibCalls
  numFibCalls += 1
  
  if x == 0 or x == 1:
    return 1
  else:
    return fib(x-1) + fib(x-2)


def testFib(n):
  for i in range(n+1):
    global numFibCalls
    numFibCalls = 0
    print 'fib of', i, '=', fib(i)
    print 'fib called', numFibCalls, 'times.'

```

* At each function call, `global numFibCalls` tells Python that **numCalls** should be defined at the outermost scope, **NOT** within the scope of the function.

* Without `global numFibCalls`, `numFibCalls` would have been local to each of `fib` and `testFib`, meaning with their own copy of `numFibCalls`.

* Both `fib` and `testFib` have access to the same `numFibCalls`, i.e. the same object in the memory. 

* `testFib` binds `numFibCalls` to 0 each time it calls `fib`.

* `fib` increments the value of `numFibCalls` at each call.

Computer scientists do not like global variables very much because they can lead to lots of problems. Locality makes your programs readable by understanding one piece at a time. The same global variable can be modified or read in a wide variety of places, so it can destroy locality. Nevertheless, there are times when they are just what is needed.
