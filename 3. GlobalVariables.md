Suppose we want to know how many recursive calls are made in Fibonacci function.
We could do that by counting the number of calls with a **global variable**.

* Normally, functions communicate with their environment **solely** through their parameters and return values. 
* For most of the time, this is the right thing to do. 
* Every once in a while, global variables come in handy.

```
def fib(x):
  """Assumes x an int >= 0
  Returns Fibonacci of x"""

  global numFibCalls
  numFibCalls += 1
  
  if x == 0 or x == 1:
    return 1
  else:
    return fib(x-1) + fib(x-2)


def testFib(n):
  for i in range(n+1):
    global numFibCalls
    numFibCalls = 0
    print 'fib of', i, '=', fib(i)
    print 'fib called', numFibCalls, 'times.'

```

* At each function call, `global numFibCalls` tells Python that **numFibCalls** should be defined at the outermost scope, **NOT** within the scope of the function.

* Without `global numFibCalls`, `numFibCalls` would have been local to each of `fib` and `testFib`, meaning with their own copy of `numFibCalls`.

* Both `fib` and `testFib` have access to the same `numFibCalls`, i.e. the same object in the memory. 

* `testFib` binds `numFibCalls` to 0 each time it calls `fib`.

* `fib` increments the value of `numFibCalls` at each call.

Computer scientists do not like global variables very much because they can lead to lots of problems. Locality makes your programs readable by understanding one piece at a time. The same global variable can be modified or read in a wide variety of places, so it can destroy locality. Nevertheless, there are times when they are just what is needed.

**`nonlocal` Variables**

Nonlocal variables are used in nested functions whose local scope is not defined. This means that the variable can be neither in the local nor the global scope. 

It works in exactly the same way as the global statement, except that it is used to refer to variables that are neither global nor local to the function.

We use the `nonlocal` keyword to create nonlocal variables.

```
def outer():
  x = "local"

  def inner():
    nonlocal x
    x = "nonlocal"
    print("inner:", x)

  inner()
  print("outer:", x)

outer()
```
