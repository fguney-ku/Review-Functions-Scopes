Why recursion?

* take a complicated problem, and solve it by splitting into smaller sub-problems using recursion

* especially useful with sequences, e.g. lists

* simple-looking code, effective most of the time


Why not recursion?

* could use a lot of memory, growing number of calls

* sometimes hard to see or debug

**Example:**
We can determine how many digits a positive integer has by repeatedly dividing by 10 (without keeping the remainder) until the number is less than 10, consisting of only 1 digit. We add 1 to this value for each time we divided by 10. Here is the recursive algorithm:

```
if n < 10 
  return 1
else
  return 1 + the number of digits in n/10 ignoring the fractional part
```

Implement and test this recursive algorithm in Python with the values 15, 105, and 15105.

**Hint:** Remember you can do integer division with ``//``
